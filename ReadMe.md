First download the [data recognizer dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data) from kaggle website.

In, model.ipynb, I performed following steps to train the classfication model of CNN.
1. Added Dataset into current kaggle path by using "Add Data" option in side bar.
2. Import require libraries and read the dataset.
3. Applied require PreProcessing on dataset.
5. Create CNN model architecture. 
6. CNN Model Trainining
7. Model Prediction on test dataframe.
